# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Ruby using object-oriented programming principles. It was created as part of my learning journey to strengthen my programming skills using ruby.

## Features

- Two-player mode: Play against a friend in turn-based gameplay.
- Valid move validation:
  - Ensures players cannot overwrite occupied spaces.
  - Checks for valid input range (1-9).
- Win and draw detection:
  - Automatically detects when a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- Interactive gameplay:
  - Continuously updates the board after each move.

## Tools

- **Ruby**: For building the game logic and structure.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - `Game`: Manages game flow and player turns.
  - `Board`: Handles the grid and win/draw detection.
  - `Player`: Stores player details like name and symbol.

## Objective

Create a game that:

- Reinforces fundamental OOP concepts.
- Provides a fun and interactive way to learn Ruby.
- Helps practice software design and user input handling.

## Insights

- Gained experience with OOP in Ruby.
- Improved understanding of class interactions and encapsulation.
- Learned to implement win conditions and game-ending logic.
- Encountered and resolved challenges related to validating moves and updating the board dynamically.

## Future Plans

- Add a computer opponent with basic AI.
- Implement a graphical interface using a library like Ruby's `Tk`.
- Refactor code to make it more modular and scalable.

## Personal Thoughts

- It was hard to structure the code at first, like determining the classes and what to do with them. It took some time to get used to, but after finding the flow, it was real fun!
- One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that players could not overwrite occupied spaces. Debugging the `valid_move?` method taught me how to effectively test edge cases and improve my logic.  
- Overall, this project was enjoyable and a valuable learning experience. Iâ€™m excited to explore additional features and make the game even more engaging!
- It's a simple program, but it's honest work!
